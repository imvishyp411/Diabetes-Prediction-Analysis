## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle. It includes various health-related features and a target variable indicating diabetes status.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data. The Jupyter Notebook includes visualizations and statistical analysis of the dataset.

## Model Building
Build a Random Forest classification model to predict diabetes. This includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall.

## Usage
To use the Random Forest model for diabetes prediction:

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb.
Follow the code and comments to load data, preprocess it, build the model, and make predictions.
